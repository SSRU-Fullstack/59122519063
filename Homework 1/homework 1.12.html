        The Witcher short stories by the author <b>Andrzej Sapkowski</b> were first published in Polish science fiction and
        fantasy magazine Fantastyka, beginning in the mid-1980s. The first short story, "Wiedźmin" <b>("The Witcher")
        (1986)</b>, was written for a contest held by the magazine and won third place. The first four stories dealing with
        the witcher Geralt of Rivia were originally featured in a 1990 short story collection titled Wiedźmin <b>(The
        Witcher)</b> — now out of print — with "Droga, z której się nie wraca" <i><u>("The Road with No Return")</u></i>, which is set
        before the Witcher stories and features Geralt's mother-to-be.
