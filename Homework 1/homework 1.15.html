    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second published short story collection was Sword of Destiny (orig.
        Miecz przeznaczenia). Although The Last Wish (orig. Ostatnie życzenie) was published after Sword of Destiny, it
        replaced The Witcher as the first book since it included all the stories in The Witcher, except "The Road with
        No Return" (the only story without Geralt). Although new short stories were added to The Last Wish, they took
        place before those in Sword of Destiny.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although "The Road with No Return" and "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna"
        ("Something Ends, Something Begins", an alternate ending of the Witcher saga about Geralt and Yennefer's wedding
        written as a wedding gift for Sapkowski's friends) were later published in 2000 in Something Ends, Something
        Begins and in 2012 in Maladie and Other Stories (Maladie i inne opowiadania) collections, the other stories in
        those books are unconnected to the Witcher series. In some Polish editions, "The Road with No Return" and
        "Something Ends, Something Begins" are added to The Last Wish or Sword of Destiny.</p>
